                <p class="paragraphs">Hi, I am John Daquavious Michael Hoppkins, that's not my actual name, but you get the point. I will talk about me, this website, and the things I plan to do.<br><br>I am a [REDACTED] years old amateur web developer from Bulgaria, but to get to where we are, we must go back a little. I was always fascinated by technology and IT related things, at the age of 7, I was upgrading the family computers and tinkering on them. Around this time, I tried learning a bit of Python, but was unmotivated, so unfortunately I could not use my earlier interests to gain a headstart in my coding journey, but still, I plan to learn a lot along the remaining long years of life I have. <br><br>Recently, I started learning the basics of web development, over some time, I got better, but I am not perfect, I've got miles to go to have mastered this field. However, I plan to move to low-level programming (i.e: C) and return to web development later on.<br><br>I'll end the paragraph on me here, because you will probably be bored as hell if I made it longer.</p>
                <h3 class="headers">This website</h3>
                <p class="paragraphs">This website was originally meant as a submission to 'Swirl', a web development 'You Ship, We Ship' program run by Hack Club, an NPO based in Vermont. I ended up procrastinating a lot while making this (an unhealthy habit I will soon fix), however, I will modify the site and put it as my servers landing page because I like the way it turned out. Other than that, not much to say on this site.<p>
                <h3 class="headers">Projects I plan to do, and what this site will become</h3>
                <p class="paragraphs">After this is submitted to Swirl, I will most likely change a few things, and configure it so my server has an actual landing page and not just a server login, I will host my projects on the server, including games, apps or whatever I make.<br><br>Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.</p>
